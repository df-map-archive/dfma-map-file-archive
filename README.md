# DFMA Map File Archive

The Dwarf Fortress Map Archive is a repository and online viewer for player created maps exported from Dwarf Fortress. The site revolves around an optimized file format (.FDF-MAP), which can produce files 1/2000th the size of the ouputted bitmaps (for a 28 layer map) and 1/20th the size of equivalent PNG files. This makes them small enough to upload and transfer across the web without chewing up bandwidth.

## Map File Archive

This map file archive is an archive of dwarf fortress maps (FDFMAP files) and associated data (Description, ).

## Roadmap

### 2017 November

- Initial idea to create HTML/JS version of Map Archive discussed with Casey Link
- Created [df-map-archive organisation](https://github.com/df-map-archive) on github
- Created [dfma-map-file-archive](https://github.com/df-map-archive/dfma-map-file-archive) namespace for archiving maps

### 2018 April

- Download and preserve *.fdfmap* files from https://mkv25.net/dfma/ in this repo

### 2018 June
- Download and preserve MySQL data attached to *fdf-maps*
- Communicate plans on public Dwarf Fortress forums
- Export and preserve map data (Maps, Map Series, Points of Interest, and Comments) as JSON
- Provide PHP and NodeJS scripts to automate the JSON export process

### Footnote

The map archive has slowed in its use, but is an excellent resource for early Dwarf Fortress gameplay, and has allowed many great stories to be shared over the years. I hope that by providing this archive of the website that we can build a new site that will continue to support these stories into the future.
