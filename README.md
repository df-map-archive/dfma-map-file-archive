# DFMA Map File Archive

### Motivation

To help share, and preserve Dwarf Fortress stories for aeons to come.

### Purpose

The DFMA is place to upload maps, tell stories, tracks points of interest, comments, and communiity favourites - bringing to life fortresses through interactive snapshots submitted by the community.

### Underlying Technology
The Dwarf Fortress Map Archive (DFMA) is a repository and online viewer for player created maps exported from Dwarf Fortress. The site revolves around an optimized file format (.FDF-MAP), which can produce files 1/2000th the size of the ouputted bitmaps (for a 28 layer map) and 1/20th the size of equivalent PNG files. This makes them small enough to upload and transfer across the web without chewing up bandwidth. 


## Map File Archive

This map file archive is an archive of dwarf fortress maps (*.fdf-map files*) and any  associated descriptive data, such as author, submitter, fortress name, map year, map season, submission date, points of interest, and description.

There are gaps in this data, this is a stalled project that needs love, work, and attention.


## Project Roadmap

Any/all future work is being tracked through the shared github project page for through the [df-map-archive](https://github.com/orgs/df-map-archive) organisation on github.

## Timeline

### 2017 November

- Initial idea to create HTML/JS version of Map Archive discussed with Casey Link
- Created [df-map-archive organisation](https://github.com/df-map-archive) on github
- Created [dfma-map-file-archive](https://github.com/df-map-archive/dfma-map-file-archive) namespace for archiving maps

### 2018 April

- Download and preserve *.fdf-map* files from https://mkv25.net/dfma/ to local machine
- Archiving stalled due to file size restrictions on repositories - lost motivation

### 2019 February
- Archiving stalled due to file size restrictions on repositories
- Looking for solutions; may just pay the cost

### 2020 May

- Jacob Blomquist creates a new P5.js and HTML5 Canvas map viewer for fdf-maps, and releases it on an MIT license: http://blomquist.xyz/dfma/ / https://github.com/JacobRBlomquist/DFMA-Viewer-HTML5
- Created a new [DF Map Archiive project space](https://github.com/orgs/df-map-archive/projects/1) to track and prioritise work

### New Plan

- Break repo down into multi year backups, e.g. pre-2008, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019
- Automate process of creating multi-repo backups using template script

### Footnote

The map archive has slowed in its use, but is an excellent resource for early Dwarf Fortress gameplay, and has allowed many great stories to be shared over the years. I hope that by providing this archive of the website that we can build a new site that will continue to support these stories into the future.
